This is my budget tracker created with javascript, html and sass. To use this budget tracker there are 2 inputs, one for income and the other for expenses. You can input both a description as well as an amount. 
Once you input your data, press the green button to add it to the UI below. You can also press the remove button on the right to remove any income or expenses that you no longer want.
